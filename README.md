## Key Features Breakdown

### 1. State Management (Zustand)

The application uses Zustand for centralized state management with localStorage persistence:

- `tasks`: Array of all tasks
- `searchQuery`: Current search filter
- `filteredTasks`: Tasks filtered by search query
- `moveTask()`: Updates task status when dragged
- `setSearchQuery()`: Filters tasks based on search input
- `initializeTasks()`: Loads tasks from JSON or localStorage

### 2. Drag & Drop (@dnd-kit)

Implements smooth drag-and-drop functionality:

- Tasks can be dragged between any swimlane
- Visual feedback during drag (opacity change)
- Drag overlay shows card preview
- Status automatically updates on drop
- Changes persist to localStorage

### 3. Search Functionality

Real-time search feature:

- Filters tasks as user types
- Case-insensitive matching
- Searches task titles
- Updates all swimlanes dynamically
- Maintains state during drag operations

### 4. Data Persistence

All changes are automatically saved:

- localStorage integration via Zustand persist middleware
- Task status updates persist across page reloads
- Initial data loaded from `tasks.json`
- Subsequent changes stored in browser

### 5. Responsive Design

Mobile-first approach with breakpoints:

- Sidebar hidden on mobile (<768px)
- Header adjusts for smaller screens
- Swimlanes scroll horizontally on mobile
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Optimized spacing and sizing

## Available Scripts

```bash
# Development server with Turbopack
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Run ESLint
npm run lint
```

## Data Structure

Each task contains:

```typescript
{
  id: string;              // Unique identifier
  title: string;           // Task name
  status: TaskStatus;      // 'todo' | 'inprogress' | 'approved' | 'reject'
  category: TaskCategory;  // Task category/type
  assignees: Assignee[];   // Team members assigned
  attachments?: number;    // Number of attachments
  comments?: number;       // Number of comments
  dueDate?: string;        // Due date (if any)
  priority: TaskPriority;  // 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  // ... additional optional fields
}
```

## Customization

### Adding New Tasks

Edit `src/data/tasks.json` and add new task objects to the `tasks` array.

### Changing Swimlane Columns

Modify the swimlane definitions in `src/components/Board.tsx`:

```tsx
<Swimlane title="Your Title" status="your-status" tasks={getTasksByStatus('your-status')} />
```

### Styling

All styles use TailwindCSS utility classes. Modify component files or extend `tailwind.config.ts` for custom themes.
